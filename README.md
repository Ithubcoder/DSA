# Student Grade Management System

This simple project showcases the basic concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms in C language.

A simple student records management system written in C is a console-based application that allows users to manage student information. The core functionalities typically include:

Adding New Students: Users can input student details such as ID, name, and GPA to add a new student record to the system.
Viewing All Students: Users can display a list of all stored student records.
Finding a Student by ID: Users can search for a specific student using their unique ID.
Saving and Loading Data: The system can save student records to a file and load them from a file, ensuring data persistence between sessions.

The system uses a simple array to store student records and provides a text-based menu for user interaction. The implementation involves basic file handling to read and write data, making it a straightforward yet practical example of file I/O and data management in C.
