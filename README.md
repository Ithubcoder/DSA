# Student Grade Management System

This simple project showcases the basic concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms in C language.

A simple student records management system written in C is a console-based application that allows users to manage student information. The core functionalities typically include:

Adding New Students: Users can input student details such as ID, name, and GPA to add a new student record to the system.
Viewing All Students: Users can display a list of all stored student records.
Finding a Student by ID: Users can search for a specific student using their unique ID.
Saving and Loading Data: The system can save student records to a file and load them from a file, ensuring data persistence between sessions.

The system uses a simple array to store student records and provides a text-based menu for user interaction. The implementation involves basic file handling to read and write data, making it a straightforward yet practical example of file I/O and data management in C.


# Calculator

A basic calculator program that can evaluate arithmetic expressions, handle variables, and perform advanced mathematical functions. The code includes:

1. Stack Class: A utility class to manage stack operations like push, pop, and peek.
2. Mathematical Functions: Functions to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and trigonometric and logarithmic calculations.
3. Tokenization: A function to break down an arithmetic expression into tokens (numbers, operators, and functions).
4. Infix to Postfix Conversion: A function to convert infix expressions (standard arithmetic notation) to postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation) for easier evaluation.
5. Postfix Evaluation: A function to evaluate the postfix expression, including variable handling and mathematical function calls.
6. Calculator Function: The main function that handles user input, converts expressions, evaluates them, and manages variables.
7. User Interaction: The program allows continuous input of expressions, supports variable assignment, and maintains a history of calculations.
The code is designed to run in a loop, accepting expressions from the user until "exit" is entered.
